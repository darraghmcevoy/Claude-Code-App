## Usage

The task manager provides several commands:

```bash
# Add a new task
task-manager add "Buy milk"

# Add a task with priority, due date, category, and tags
task-manager add "Submit report" --due-date 2024-05-01 --priority high --category "Work" --tags "urgent,important"

# List all tasks
task-manager list

# List tasks with filters
task-manager list --hide-completed --category "Work" --tag "urgent" --search "report"

task-manager complete 1

# Delete a task by its ID
task-manager delete 1

Tasks are stored in a local `tasks.json` file in the same directory as the script.
